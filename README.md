Abstract:
Spatial language is part of everyday life and, therefore, very common in writing. With the exponential increase in the number of textual data on the internet, there has been a lot of demand for the development of machine learning methods to interpret prepositional spatial relations (Radke et al., 2019). In this article, we propose our first trial to build a Multinomial Naive Bayes to tackle the problem. To train and test our model to classify sentences into SPATIAL or NON-SPATIAL, we used a small dataset of examples containing spatial prepositions from grammar websites. The results seem promising although both our corpus and our classifier’s accuracy can still be improved.
